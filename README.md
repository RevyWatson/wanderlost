Our group was tasked with creating a fully functional application and presenting it to our peers.

## Project Acceptance Criteria
* Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Must be deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
* Must be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Needs to utilize at least two server-side APIs.
* Uses modals (no alerts, confirms, or prompts).
* Must use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Should be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* The repository should be clean and meet quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* There should be a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## User Story
* As a hiker and or outdoor adventurer,
* I want to locate trails on a map,
* I want to see the current weather for that location,
* So that I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Our Vision
Our group shares a common love of exploring the outdoors and hiking. As we shared stories of our separate adventures wandering the wilds of this world, we quickly realized that we've all experienced getting lost and accidentally roaming off trail. Despite having access to trail guide books and provided park pamphlets there's still plenty of room for one to get lost while hiking. Especially if a trail systems isn't properly marked or lacks signage. It became clear that we wanted to build an application that would provide hiking trail locator and accurate weather updates for our home state of Michigan. 

## Technology Utilized
This application was built using dynamic HTML, CSS, and is powered by JavaScript. We chose to utilize the CSS framework [Foundation](https://get.foundation/) by ZURB Inc. For the weather reports we used the API [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). To find trail maps we used the API [Michigan DNR Designated Hiking Pathways](https://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/3d190eb423fa4e578049faf36654a8ab_1/data?geometry=-123.954%2C38.557%2C-50.873%2C49.561). We sourced the map from the API [Open Street](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/38.891/-97.141). We used [Leaflet Interactive Map Guide](https://leafletjs.com/) for the markers on the map.

## Future Development
After a long day of hiking and exploring adventurers always look forward to a good meal and having a safe comfortable place to sleep. That’s why in the future we'd like this application to include a search option for nearby lodging (hotels, motels, camping, airbnb, etc) and local dining options. Perhaps even add a feature finder. Initially we had hoped to have a larger scope for our trail search. We have hopes of expanding this application to locate trails on a national or even global scope. Ideally we’d also love to include extensive trail maps, a photo of the trail head and trail reviews.
